An unfinished token presale DAPP for Solana.

Rust/Anchor_lang backend - React/Nextjs/Typescript frontend

This project was inspired by the Solana Sandstorm Hackathon.

Unfortunately, I ran into a few long-lasting bugs while building the project which lead to the project overruning the deadline.
I'm still trying to figure out where I am going wrong with SPL-token CPIs.
I will continue to work on the project until I complete my goal.

Feel free to DM me on twitter '@zombieghostmg'!
